## Why OOP?

- If you are following fully oops concept then it makes you complex code easier, more relieable, more maintainable, and generally better.

- OOP insists that you think about what you expose to the outside world, it lets you change the implementation of an object without affecting any other code. (Encapsulation)

- It allows you to have many different functions, all with the same name, all doing the same job, but on different data. (Polymorphism)

- It lets you write generic code: which will work with a range of data, so you don't have to write basic stuff over, and over again. (Generics)

- It lets you write a set of functions, then expand them in different direction without changing or copying them in any way. (Inheritance)
