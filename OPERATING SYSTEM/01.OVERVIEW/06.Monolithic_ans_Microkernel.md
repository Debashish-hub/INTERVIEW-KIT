## Monolithic kernel

All the parts of a kernel like the Scheduler, File System, Memory Management, Networking Stacks, Device Drivers, etc., are maintained in one unit within the kernel in Monolithic Kernel

### Advantages

- Faster processing

### Disadvantages

- Crash Insecure 

- Porting Inflexibility 

- Kernel Size explosion

Examples MS-DOS, Unix, Linux


## Micro kernel

Only the very important parts like IPC(Inter process Communication), basic scheduler, basic memory handling, basic I/O primitives etc., are put into the kernel. Communication happen via message passing. Others are maintained as server processes in User Space

### Advantages

- Crash Resistant, Portable, Smaller Size

### Disadvantages

- Slower Processing due to additional Message Passing

Examples Windows NT
