## What is Topology?

Network topologies describe the methods in which all the elements of a network are mapped. The topology term refers to both the physical and logical layout of a network.

### Types of Networking Topologies

Two main types of network topologies in computer networks are 1) Physical topology 2) Logical topology

### Physical topology:

This type of network is an actual layout of the computer cables and other network devices

### Logical topology:

Logical topology gives insight's about network's physical design.

Different types of Physical Topologies are:

- P2P Topology

- Bus Topology

- Ring Topology

- Star Topology

- Tree Topology

- Mesh Topology

- Hybrid Topology
